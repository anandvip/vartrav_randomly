title: Focused State vs Defuesed State of mind

Switch modes quite often. Yes, staying in the same state of a very long duration can be frazzling. Listening to the inner calls of exhaustion is like, **acting wise**. Try it, initially everything seems a little awkward, however, after a few mindfull attempts, it seems to set in as a natural response. (inner engineering) 

I still see the demanding job that requires hours of focused work as savagery.
Just take a break for a while and give two hoots to the performance freeks and profit mongering mindsets who consider "every peny i am pying to get the job done must be worth it" WTF dude.

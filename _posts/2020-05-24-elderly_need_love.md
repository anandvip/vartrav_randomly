Many of us have our ageing parents at home and probably you are living with on.

yes there are many moments when we find the strong opinions coming to you as road blocks, but can that stop us from loving them? Never forget those opinions are coming from the minds of people whom we love and accept as they are. It cannot trouble us nor do we have to adopt them as they were formed in their experience and may not be relevant in present scenario.

I am speaking generally, nothing specific. we all form different opinions during this journey, nothing of it will affect anything or anyone, once we are gone.

This monologue is literally happens to me most of the time, asking myself lot of what if's.

just give love to them, serve them food with love. you would find pleasing surprises coming your way sooner than you think.

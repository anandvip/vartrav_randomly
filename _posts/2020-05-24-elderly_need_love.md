Many of us have our ageing parents at home and probably you are living with on.

yes there are many moments when we find the strong opinions coming to you as road blocks, but that should stop us from loving them, right?

This monologue is literally happens to me most of the time, asking myself lot of what if's.

just give love to them, serve them food with love. you would find pleasing surprises coming your way sooner than you think.

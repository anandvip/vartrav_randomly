Today was a tiring day. Yes, no doubt. Paddy fields ready for transplantation tomorrow. Have to get the labour ready with morning tea and lunch. whatever, enjoy your drink. 

Year after year the thought streams are the same. this year rains are favourable and sun is showing up in between rains, Everything is going to be fine. 

kids need medical attention. Let's see tomorrow noon, maybe I should be able to take them to village doctor.

Half bottle is over, enough man, now sleep. Thanks to the benevolent universe for guiding me.
